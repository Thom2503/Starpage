Here is my startpage
With some links to my most used websites. (these can be changed in the HTML file)
Images are from this artist:
[Link to pixiv artist (のえる)](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/5553811 "のえる on Pixiv")
These can also be changed in via the img tags in the HTML file.


There is a search engine which I use a lot. It looks the things up on DuckDuckGo.
For google the searchUrl variable on line 15 in Index.js needs to be changed to:
*Google: "https://www.google.com/search?q="
*DuckDuckGo: "https://duckduckgo.com/?q="
